# WPFoverlay
WPF .net c# overlay capable of running c# commands in runtime via the provided overlay and speech recognition


This is an open source project capable of running c# commands in runtime via the overlay provided or with microsoft's speech recognition built in with my application.
I warn you that this application is succeptable to running various ( including malicious ) scripts. If you do not recieve this software from https://github.com/frenemations/WPFoverlay then please verify the contents of commands.xml to ensure there are no malicious scripts.
This application is provided with an as is warranty and will be full of bugs that I intend to squash.


I advise you to go to Control Panel\Ease of Access\Speech Recognition and do the "Train your computer to understand you better" course. It will improve speech recognition accuracy vastly.
This application is intended for windows users.
